This table includes discussion summaries and lecture notes for the first 6 sessions. From session #7 on, class discussion focused on individual student projects.

| SESÂ # | SUMMARY | NOTES |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Discussion: Might the natural frequencies of karabiner gates and ropes match under certain circumstances that would cause the karabiner gate to be open during fall arrest? | Summary of In-class Derivation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mites_255s06_rpe_osillmdel)) |
| 2 | Open Questions in Rock Climbing | Presentation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mites_255s06_oqs_pres)) |
| 3 | Discussion of karabiner-rope Coupling | Summary of Discussion ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mites_255s06_class_3review)) |
| 4 | Rope Behavior | Presentation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mites_255s06_rope_behav)) |
| 5 | Three student projects defined:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}\- Measurement of karabiner gate opening due to oscillation, both in-vitro (say glued to a speaker cone) and in-vivo (in a drop test).  {{< br >}}\- Modeling of the frequency matching between rope and karabiner gate oscillation.  {{< br >}}\- Rope middle marking. | &nbsp; |
| 6 | Measured the frequency of rope oscillation.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Measured the spring constant of a karabiner and came up with an estimate for the oscillation frequency of the gate (~25 Hz).  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Marked nylon and tried to see if any changes were observable under a light microscope ~100x magnification. No changes were readily apparent. | Rope Oscillation Experiment ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mites_255s06_rope_oscil))
